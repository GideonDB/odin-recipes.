<strong> I am showcasing how to make my Water today</strong> 
<p> It is pretty basic, but hey, I love water!<p>
	<h3> Ingredients</h3>
	<p>In this section, we are quickly going to cover the ingredients, that way you can get drinkin.<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Water</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Finally, we are going to run through the steps!</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>Actually some options, first, you must decide what you're looking for, we have a lot of options.</li>
	<li>Pre-purchase, (store)-"boring." I prefer to do it natural, we're going hiking.</li>
	<li>We're going to check Google Maps, find the nearest body of water to you!</li>
	<li>Do not worry if the water is not safe, water is drinkable and recommended by Doctors.</li>
	<li>Get in your car and drive to that body of water.</li>
	<li>Oops, got to excited and forgot the cup.</li> 
	<li>Go back and get a cup, we don't want to be jumping in the water, that'd look weird as shit!</li>
	<li>Perfect, made it to the body of water.</li>
	<li>At this point, it is pretty simple, fill up the cup, drink and enjoy!</li>
<em> Hope you enjoyed! Awesome water recipe.</em>
